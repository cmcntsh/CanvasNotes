# Canvas Notes

Various notes on working with Canvas.

## Cross-list class sections

* Link to instructions: https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-cross-list-a-section-in-a-course-as-an-instructor/ta-p/1261
* The instructions on that page are pretty good. There are screen shots on there, too.
* Cross-listing should be done while courses are unpublished. Coursework is retained with the course, not with the section enrollments, so if a published course is cross-listed, all cross-listed enrollments will lose any associated assignment submissions and grades.
* To cross-list a course, you must know the name of the course or the course ID into which you are cross-listing. However, using a course ID is a better way to confirm you are cross-listing a section into the correct course. You can find the course ID by opening the course and viewing the number at the end of the browser URL (e.g. account.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXX).
* Open course you want to cross list into the other course. (You need the number of the course in the step above.)
* Open course settings (menu down left side of page at the bottom)
* Click on the Sections tab (menu along the top)
* Click on the section link listed in the Sections section.
* Click on Cross-list this section button.
* Enter the course ID and click out of the field. The course you're cross-listing into should come up.
* Click on the Cross-list this section button.
* The new section should now appear in the sections tab of the main course.
