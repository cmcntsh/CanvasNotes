# Canvas Notes

Various notes on working with Canvas.

## Cross-list class sections

* Link to instructions: https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-cross-list-a-section-in-a-course-as-an-instructor/ta-p/1261
* The instructions on that page are pretty good. There are screen shots on there, too.
* Cross-listing should be done while courses are unpublished. Coursework is retained with the course, not with the section enrollments, so if a published course is cross-listed, all cross-listed enrollments will lose any associated assignment submissions and grades.
* To cross-list a course, you must know the name of the course or the course ID into which you are cross-listing. However, using a course ID is a better way to confirm you are cross-listing a section into the correct course. You can find the course ID by opening the course and viewing the number at the end of the browser URL (e.g. account.instructure.com/courses/XXXXXX).
* Open course you want to cross list into the other course. (You need the number of the course in the step above.)
* Open course settings (menu down left side of page at the bottom)
* Click on the Sections tab (menu along the top)
* Click on the section link listed in the Sections section.
* Click on Cross-list this section button.
* Enter the course ID and click out of the field. The course you're cross-listing into should come up.
* Click on the Cross-list this section button.
* The new section should now appear in the sections tab of the main course.

## Video Quiz with Grades

Some resources on creating a video quiz (quiz questions asked at certain points in a video) and recording points from the quiz in the Canvas grade book.

## Bulk Import Quiz Questions into Canvas from Word or Excel files

* Install Respondus on your Windows computer.
  * The installation password can be obtained by going to https://www.uen.org/ and clicking the Respondus link under the Higher Education tab.
  * You'll need the username and password to enter the page. (r____, U____)
  * You'll need to request temporary admin rights to install on a CON laptop. (log into VPN, Software Center, Request Temp Admin, Explain what is needed in text box. Submit. Wait for approval to be granted.)
* Instructions for importing files can be found at Respondus - Help - Help Topics
  * A popup window will appear. See Start Menu - Importing Questions to Respondus
  * Additional information about the file formats used for bulk importing questions can be found in the Appendix.
  * Respondus will install sample files on your Windows computer at Documents - Respondus Projects - (See WorldHistory.csv or WorldHistory.tab)
* Create your import file. (I personally prefer to use .csv files because it's easy to have each question on a separate row. I have tried importing using a Word file, because the Respondus help says Respondus will automatically import images included in a Word file. I can see the images in the Respondus preview, but the images don't seem to make it to the U of U Canvas system and I have to manually add images to those questions.)
* Respondus - Start - Open or Create - Import Questions - Follow steps outlined
  * #1 Select the file to Import:
  * Type of File: Tab/Comma Delimited (CSV) [or select one of the other file types if using something different]
  * File name: [Browse to find your question file and select it.]
  * A CSV Import Options popup window will appear. I like to click on Preview before clicking OK.
  * #2 Choose where to add the new Questions:
  * Create a new document, named: [Use something descriptive so you can find it later in Canvas. I like to have something with short version of the Canvas module name and the topics and "assignment" or "quiz".]
  * #3 Use the Preview button to check for problems:
  * Click Preview
  * Fix any problems that are listed in the Warnings and Notes: at the bottom.
  * #4 Press the Finish button to complete the process.
  * Click Finish (Note: You can't have the file open on your computer, or Respondus won't be able to upload the file.)
* Respondus - Preview + Publish
  * You should Preview before you publish.
  * If you see any typos, you can fix them by clicking on Modify Item and saving your changes. You will go back to the preview window after you save your modifications.
  * Follow the steps in the Publish Wizard.
  * #1 Type of Publish: Publish to a single course
  * #2 Choose and existing server, or "add new server" to add settings information for a new server:
  * Canvas Server: [The first time you do this you'll enter a name. I just used the suggested "My Canvas Courses".
  * You'll need to select your institution (University of Utah) the first time you do this. Afterwards, the setting should already be there.
  * You'll need to get temporary administrator rights to be able to connect to the U of U server for your Canvas Course the first time you do this.
  * #3 Press [Next] to connect to server

  * Popup window: Log into your learning system using the browser window.

  * #1 Select assessment type
  * Question Bank will load questions into a question bank you can find later when creating a new quiz in Canvas.
  * Graded Quiz will create a new quiz in your course that includes all the questions.
  * #2 Specify server action and item name.
  * I just used the defaults.
  * #3 Other options
  * I left both options unchecked.
  * #4 Press [Next] to choose a location on the server.
  * Select the course where you want the questions to go from the list.
  * The list will expand to show quizzes, but you don't need to select anything. Just click Next.
  * This part will take a minute. Be patient. Once you see the message "--Publish Completed Successfully--" you can click Finish.
  * Log into Canvas and go to your course.
  * You should find your new quiz if you selected Graded Quiz earlier. You will need to create a new quiz and select Find Questions and locate your question bank if you selected Question Bank earlier.
